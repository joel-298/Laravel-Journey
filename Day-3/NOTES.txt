CONTROLLER IN LARAVEL : 

    WHAT IS A CONTROLLER ? 
        - The controller comes under MVC architecture. 
        - The Controller handles requires from user 
            - Display view. 
            - Handle database. 
        - We an say that : The controller is a central unit that handles user request, model and views



IN THIS FILE WE CREATED A USER CONTROLLER CLASS AND INSIDE OF THAT WE CREATED SOME FUNCTIONS 
IN THESE FUNCTIONS WE RETURNED HTML PAGES FROM VIEWS 
FLOW STRUCTURE : Routes -> Controller -> (functions returning html pages) -> Views

We also learn how to pass values from urls to controllers and functions and to html pages 
EXAMPLE : 
    a) ROUTE :- Route::get("user/{name}", [UserController::class,'getUserDetails']); // Passing variable from url to this function !
    b) CONTROLLER :- function getUserDetails($name)  
    c) VIEWS :- return view('user', ['name' => $name]) ; // this user is a html page i.e user.blade.php
